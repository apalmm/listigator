# Listigator

Listigator is a web application that allows users to search through state databases of lawyers, create lists of lawyers, and search through the lists of other users. 

The goal of this app is to allow people in need of legal assistance or organizations such as legal assistance services to be easily able to acquire and share information about lawyers in their geographic region

Lawyers can be searched with multiple parameters, and lists can be set as public or private. Users can view their own lists through the "My Lists" page, and can view the contents of their lists by clicking on the names of the lists. Users can view all public lists on the "All Lists" page, and can also see all the public lists of individual users by clicking on their usernames.
